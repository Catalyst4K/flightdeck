/**
 * Generates THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md — the notice document shipped inside the packaged
 * app (see electron-builder.yml's `files`).
 *
 * Why this is generated rather than hand-maintained: several of the licences Flightdeck
 * depends on require the licence text and copyright notice to be *reproduced* in
 * distributions (MIT, BSD-3-Clause, Apache-2.0, ISC), and LGPL-3.0 requires rather more
 * than that (see the node-simconnect section it emits). A hand-written list silently goes
 * stale the first time a dependency is added or bumped, and the failure mode is a
 * licence violation rather than a broken build.
 *
 * Run `npm run licenses:generate` after changing production dependencies, and commit the
 * result. Only `dependencies` are walked — devDependencies are build-time tooling and
 * don't ship. Electron itself is the exception and is covered by a hand-written note,
 * since electron-builder bundles its own licence files into the app already.

const HEADER = `# Third-party licences

Flightdeck itself is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 — see
[\`LICENSE\`](./LICENSE). This document covers the third-party code and data distributed
*with* it, and the obligations that come with them.

**This file is generated** by \`npm run licenses:generate\` from the installed production
dependencies. Don't edit it by hand; edit \`scripts/generate-third-party-licenses.ts\`
and re-run.

## GNU LGPL v3.0: node-simconnect

Flightdeck's SimConnect layer depends on [node-simconnect][ns], which is licensed under
the **GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later**. This is the one dependency
whose licence imposes obligations beyond attribution, so they're stated explicitly:

- **The library is used unmodified.** Flightdeck ships the published npm package as-is;
  no patches, no vendored fork.
- **It is dynamically loaded, not statically combined.** The build externalizes it
  (\`externalizeDepsPlugin\` in \`electron.vite.config.ts\`), so the packaged main process
  does a plain \`require("node-simconnect")\` at runtime.
- **It is replaceable.** The package is excluded from the app's asar archive
  (\`asarUnpack\` in \`electron-builder.yml\`), so it exists as ordinary files under
  \`resources/app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/node-simconnect/\` in an installed copy. A
  user may replace it with a modified or newer version of the library and run the result.
- **Corresponding source** for the exact version shipped is available from the upstream
  repository and from the npm registry, and on request from the copyright holder of
  Flightdeck at no charge.
- **The full LGPL v3.0 text** is reproduced below. LGPL v3.0 incorporates the terms of
  GPL v3.0 by reference; that text is in [\`LICENSE\`](./LICENSE).

## Bundled data

Three reference datasets are vendored into the app. Their per-file provenance and terms
are reproduced verbatim below, from \`resources/*.LICENSE.txt\` in the source repository.

**Note on the airline database:** it is licensed under the Open Database License (ODbL)
1.0, which is share-alike **for the database**. It does not place Flightdeck's own source
code under ODbL, but the dataset itself — and any redistributed derivative of it — must
remain under a free/open licence, in any distribution of this app.

`

const DATA_FILES = [
  { title: 'Airports — OurAirports', path: 'resources/airports.LICENSE.txt' },
  { title: 'Airlines — OpenFlights (ODbL 1.0)', path: 'resources/airlines.LICENSE.txt' },
  {
    title: 'Aircraft type designators — ICAO Doc 8643 list',
    path: 'resources/icao-aircraft-types.LICENSE.txt'
  }
]

## Application runtime

Flightdeck is distributed as an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) application.
Electron is MIT-licensed and embeds Chromium and Node.js, which carry their own licences;
electron-builder includes Electron's own licence files in the packaged application
alongside this document.

Airline logos shown in the interface are fetched at runtime from a third-party image
service and are not redistributed with this application. They remain the property of the
respective airlines.
