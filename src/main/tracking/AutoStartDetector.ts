// that individually *looks* plausible but isn't — `onGround` flips true a good ~30s
// before altitude has caught up, and altitude itself doesn't monotonically settle: it
// spikes to a garbage plateau (tens of thousands of feet) and holds there rock-steady
// for several seconds at a time before continuing to decay. So neither "onGround is
// true" nor "this value hasn't changed in N samples" is safe alone — both are required,
// plus a sanity ceiling on the absolute altitude, since the garbage plateaus sit far
// above any real airport's elevation.

// picker/World Map screen runs a live background scene (parked, on the ground, perfectly
// stationary — e.g. sitting at Boeing Field) that satisfies every check above just as well
// as a genuinely armed, parked flight does. Arming happens on Flightdeck's "Fly" (a
// `flightCreate`), which can land before the sim has even loaded the real flight if MSFS
// is still on that menu — so this fired against the menu's placeholder position, then the
// real load-in teleported the aircraft to the actual departure airport, recording one
// breadcrumb trail straight across the globe between the two. A coarse "is this even
// roughly at the departure airport" check rejects that placeholder position without
// needing precision — real GPS/telemetry jitter and an airport's own physical size are
// both far smaller than this. Plain Euclidean degrees (no cosine correction for
// longitude), so the real km this represents varies with latitude — irrelevant here,
// since it's only ever used as a "wildly, implausibly wrong" filter (~120km at the
// equator), not a precise distance.

/**
 * Watches SimConnect telemetry after a flight is armed (Dispatch's "Fly" button) and
 * fires once the sim shows a genuinely settled, on-the-ground aircraft — the auto-start
 * half of "hopefully the Start tracking button is unnecessary". Requires several
 * consecutive seconds of plausible, unchanging data (on the ground, altitude under a
 * sanity ceiling, position and altitude both static) rather than trusting any single
 * sample — seeded on the real reload behaviour captured by scripts/spike-flight-reload.ts
 * (see docs/decisions.md), which showed that a mid-reload garbage plateau can otherwise
 * look "stable" for several ticks at a time.
 *
 * Earlier revision required an actual *disturbance* from the armed baseline before
 * counting stable samples, on the assumption a reload always happens after arming — but
 * Callum's real usage flow is often the other way round (load the flight in MSFS first,
 * *then* press Fly), so that precondition just meant it silently never fired. Dropped:
 * the reload-garbage window is already rejected on its own physical implausibility (not
 * on the ground yet, or altitude far too high, or still changing) — nothing about that
 * protection actually depended on requiring a disturbance first. The trade-off this
 * accepted: if the sim is left mid-transition from a *different* previous flight (stale
 * position at the wrong airport) for the full ~8s stability window right as Fly is
 * pressed, it could start against that stale data. **That trade-off turned out to bite
 * for real** (Callum, 2026-09-03): MSFS's own flight-picker/World Map screen runs a live
 * background scene — parked, on the ground, perfectly stationary — that's indistinguishable
 * from a real armed flight by every check above. Arming happens on Flightdeck's "Fly"
 * (`flightCreate`), which can land while MSFS is still sitting on that menu, so this fired
 * against the menu's placeholder position and then the real load-in teleported the
 * aircraft to the actual departure airport — one breadcrumb trail straight across the
 * globe between the two. Fixed with a coarse "is this even roughly at the armed flight's
 * departure airport" check (see MAX_DEPARTURE_DISTANCE_DEG) rather than requiring an
 * upfront disturbance again, which the comment above already explains doesn't fit
 * Callum's usual flow. Dispatch's "Fly" confirmation dialog and the manual "Start
 * tracking" button remain as guardrails for whatever this still doesn't catch (e.g. two
 * airports that happen to be within the coarse threshold of each other).
